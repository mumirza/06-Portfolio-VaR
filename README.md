**What is Var and Confidence Interval**

Value at risk (VaR) is a measure of the risk of loss for investments.

Daily Value at Risk of 6.5% with a 95% confidence

There is 5% significance level that your portfolio will lose 6.5% or more in a day.

Or, we have 95% confidence level that our portfolio will not lose 6.5% in a day.

Parametric VaR (variance-covariance method): First identifies the mean, or expected value, and standard deviation of a portfolio.

What is Value at Risk (VaR)?

What is Confidence Interval?

Code: Build a Portfolio and calculate daily returns

Make Variance-Covariance Matrix, Portfolio Risk (std), Portfolio expected return (mean)

Construct a Normal Distribution curve using the results

Calculate VaR, Confidence Interval
